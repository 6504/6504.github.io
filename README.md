# Team 6504's Experimental Dart Website
This repository contains the code hosted on [fallschurchrobotics.com](http://fallschurchrobotics.com/)

The website itself is hosted as a Github Page, using Google's Dart & Flutter for a backend.

## How to Run
To run this website or build it for release, you'll need both the Flutter SDK and the Dart SDK.
Once you've gotten both, make sure that both dart and flutter are added to your PATH.
In order to get the latest version of Flutter from the beta channel and enable web support, run the following commands:

    flutter channel beta
    flutter upgrade
    flutter config --enable-web

In order to run the app, enter `flutter run -d chrome`. `https://github.com/flutter/flutter_web` is the repository for the essentials.
