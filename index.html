      <p class="lead section-lead">We are the Falls Church Robotics Team, otherwise known as Team 6504 - JagBots, based in Falls Church, Virginia. We strive to promote STEM education to our peers and our community, though various competitions and events. We participate in multiple robotics competitions, namely the FIRST Robotics Challenge (FRC), FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), and VEX Robotics.</p>
      <p class="section-paragraph">We grew from very humble roots, spawning from a branch of our high school's Technology Student Association (TSA), and growing into our own team that is now independent from our school's TSA. We hope to grow as a community and spread our influence to inspire the next generation of engineers, computer scientists, and problem-solvers. </p>
